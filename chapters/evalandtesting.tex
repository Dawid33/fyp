\chapter{Evaluation} \label{evalandtesting}

I evalutate the performance of the lexer and parser for by randomly generating JSON.  The compiler
was tested on a tweleve core Ryzen 5 3600 CPU running Linux Mint with the 5.15.0 kernel. Figure
\ref{fig:json_graph} shows the speedup achieved by increasing the number of threads used for either
lexing or parsing.
