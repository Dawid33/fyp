\begin{sectionplan}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss the various approaches mentioned in the literature review, mentioning
		  their pros and cons. Write about the issues with designing a parallel compiler,
		  e.g issues common to all approaches. Elaborate on why tech choices are being
		  made e.g using rust. 
	\item Discuss my plan / design for the compiler.

\section{Parallelisation Method}

Computing on the GPU is theoretically the option with the most available
performance. Unfortunately however,  programming on a GPU is difficult,
running small tasks on it is impractical and trying to create a compiler that
runs on the GPU requires making big concessions with regards to the compiler
architecture and language design. This leaves a combination of multicore and
\ac{simd} processing which would be most performant in the general case,
however for my \ac{fyp} I intend to only focus on the multi-threaded case.
There are other methods that exist today besides the ones Iâ€™ve mentioned so far
however they are arguably niche and not commonly available.
