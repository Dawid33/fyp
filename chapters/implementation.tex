\chapter{Implementation} \label{implementation}

For my first implementation attempt, I decided to use the Java programming
language. I chose Java because of its extensive standard library, advanced
parallel processing facilities and my existing familiarity with it. Due to
these factors I was able to quickly iterate on the programs architecture and
data structures. After finishing and testing a simple lexer and parser, I
found that the performance of the program was very dissatisfactory. Optimizing
its performance would have required a deep understanding of the Java virtual
machine. The amount of additional effort required to achieve satisfactory
performance was substantial and besides the topic of my \gls{fyp}.

I started the project over from scratch using the Rust programming language.
Rust, like Java, has very good parallel programming facilities and an extensive
software ecosystem. The experience I gained from the Java implementation meant I
had a working prototype much sooner than with my first attempt. The performance
of the Rust implementation was orders of magnitude faster, even without any
optimization. I continued implementing the relevant research and, once completed
to a satisfactory degree, I submitted this implementation. The following
sections describe its various aspects in more detail.

\begin{minted}[linenos]{text}
fn factorial[n: int] {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1;
    } 

    return (n * factorial(n - 1));
}
\end{minted}
