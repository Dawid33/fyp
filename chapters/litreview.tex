Introduction - Tell the person what you're going to tell them. Talk about what this chapter is about with reference to the various subsections of the chapter.
\end{sectionplan}

\subsection{Tokenisation}
\begin{sectionplan}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is involved in lexing.
        \item Overview of existing methods and the differences between them.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Speculative multi-threaded, potentially with pre-scanning
            \item Naive multi-threaded, potentially optimised
            \item Novel approaches
            \item Possibly mention SIMD approaches ( though they are not relevant to here)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Lexing conclusion 
    \end{itemize}
\end{sectionplan}

\subsection{Parsing}
\begin{sectionplan}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What factors generally influence parallel parsing methods?
        \item Details of lexing / parsing methods that I surveyed.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CYK
            \item Earley
            \item OPG 
            \item LLP
            \item LRP
        \end{itemize}
        \item Short conclusion comparing the surveyed methods.
        \item Content: Discuss a paper about context free grammars, parsing expression grammars and operator precedence grammars. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{sectionplan}

\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
\begin{sectionplan}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify what is in semantic anlysis
        \item What occurs during semantic analysis?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Correcting parse tree if only subset of possible grammar productions are accepted
            \item Symbol table generation
        \end{itemize}
        \item Ways of navigating an AST in parallel
    \end{itemize}
\end{sectionplan}
